It may have been hand in hand with the rising economic growth. Everyone felt they had to stay busy and get as much done as possible in order to succeed at their lives. Making coffee was usually the matter of pressing a single button. Convenience brought us the likes of Tassimo, Nespresso and other many similar amenities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNowadays, though, everything seems to be slowing down. People take time. Or maybe, they just gave up and they don\u0027t bother being in a rush any more. This brought a renaissance of rediscovering the forgotten. Decades old brewing techniques, otherwise performed only by baristas and the geekiest of coffee enthusiasts, are finding their way into everyone’s homes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe variety of devices can easily scare the uninitiated off, though. Looking at some of the more complicated brewers especially so. Take vacuum coffee makers, for example. They look like they’ve been taken straight from a chemist lab and that handling them incorrectly could make the whole block go off. Not surprisingly, then, many of us give up and opt for the ‘convenient’ way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this article, we’ll go through some of the simple of these brewing methods. Just to show you that they’re nothing to be afraid off. Making a proper cup of coffee can be super simple. Let’s get to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eChemex\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe won’t lie. This one’s our favorite. It’s super easy to use, and it’s got style (go for the wood handle variant)!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChemex produces a cup free of any bitterness. We use the 40oz Chemex, which can make 6 to 8 pretty smooth cups at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eGrind, or get about 42 grams (5-6 tablespoons) of ground coffee. The coffee shouldn’t be super-smooth, take kosher salt for reference.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ePlace the Chemex filter inside. Rinse with hot water to seal.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eRemove any left-over water.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eAdd in the ground coffee and stir briefly. This allows for a more even brewing.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eHeat water to some 205 degrees F, or let freshly boiled water off the heat for some 30-45 seconds.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ePour just enough water to saturate the grounds. Let it work for 30 seconds.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eNow, pour water evenly, spiraling around the inside of the code, until it reaches the top of the brewer.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eKeep on adding water periodically, until the brewed coffee reaches the Chemex’s glass button.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eRemove the filter and move it to a sink.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ePre-heat your mug with warm water and then pour in the freshly brewed coffee from your Chemex.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnjoy! You can easily manipulate the Chemex with the coffee in, as the handle insulates the heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cobject type=\"application/kenticocloud\" data-type=\"item\" data-id=\"e9b81664-cbca-4f0e-b1c8-e7d862f4fd89\"\u003e\u003c/object\u003e\u003ch3\u003eClever Dripper\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is probably the one that’s easiest to work with. It’s pretty easy to clean up and lets you control the steeping. The brewer is pretty durable and also safe, as it’s 100% BPA free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrews only one cup at a time, but makes a very smooth, almost chocolaty cups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eGrind, or get about 22 grams (3 tablespoons) of ground coffee. Make sure the ground is coarse.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ePut the paper filter in and rinse with warm water.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eAdd the coffee into the dripper.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ePour water and cover with a lid for about 1.5 minutes.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eRemove cover, stir and cover again.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eAfter 2 more minutes, stir one last time and place the Clever Dripper on top of a mug.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eStart draining until the cup’s full.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePretty simple right? The coffee stays in the dripper until you release it yourself, which is pretty convenient. Be careful, though, as leaving the coffee in for too long will make it bitter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHario V60\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilar to the Clever Dripper. Immediately brews into a cup so you don’t have to do the draining yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComes made from ceramic, glass or PVC and in tons of colors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProduces one cup at a time. The brew has a more ‘roasted’ taste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eGrind, or get about 22 grams (2.5 tablespoons) of ground coffee. Make sure the ground is finer, similar to table salt.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ePlace a V60 filter into the Hario.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eRinse with hot water and discard. This removes any paper taste.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eAdd coffee and shake with dripper to level the grounds evenly.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ePour in just enough water to absorb in the coffee. 30ml should do.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eLet the water absorb for 45 seconds.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThen, pour hot water steadily over the grounds, topping the Hario. Avoid directly hitting the filter.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ePour the coffee directly into your mug.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that’s it. This should be a pretty smooth a cup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t forget that you can buy all the three brewers and many others at our store! Let us know if you want to know about other techniques in the comments below.\u003c/p\u003e",
